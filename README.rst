    A Python implementation of the algorithms in the book Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
  

This project is a Python implementation of the algorithms in the book Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, you can find the online book here: https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu. The project is still under development. The following algorithms are implemented:

     - Heading row 1, column 2
     - Heading row 1, column 3

     - Row 2, column 2
     - Row 2, column 3


Name Conventions
================

Since the original code in the book is in Java, and we are using Python, we made some name conventions to be more Pythonic. 
In shorter words, we use ``snake_case`` for function names and ``CamelCase`` for class names. For more info you can refer to the `Official Python Style Guide <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names>`_ or a summary from `Real Python <https://realpython.com/python-pep8>`_.
