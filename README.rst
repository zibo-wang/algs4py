Name Conventions
================

Since the original code in the book is in Java, and we are using Python, we made some name conventions to be more Pythonic. 
In shorter words, we use ``snake_case`` for function names and ``CamelCase`` for class names. For more info you can refer to the `Official Python Style Guide <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names>`_ or a summary from `Real Python <https://realpython.com/python-pep8>`_.
